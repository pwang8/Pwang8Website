    "bio": "Back when I graduated, I realized I didn't feel confident with modern web technologies, so I decided to play around with some of the free resources available on AWS. Ended up being useful as my online resume so here we are! I've been primarily a developer using C++ and C# but I am looking for opportunities to develop my career towards either modern back-end development or product management roles.
