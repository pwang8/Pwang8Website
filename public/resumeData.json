    "bio": "Having been a dev for many years, I took a break and am now looking to transition into something new. I built this website during my university years as an excuse to gain understanding of AWS, but it ended up costing nothing to host so I decided to keep it around. I used Netlify for hosting and automatic deployment of the connected GitHub repo. The backend is hosted via a free AWS subscription, using lambda functions for the logic and DynamoDB for database. Feel free to check out the code on the linked Github account.",
